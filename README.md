# RPro9DSExplorer

If you write plugins for Retail Pro 9, perhaps you use Retail Pro's "DataStore" capability to save settings. If you do, it can be a pain to view the data, even if you have some saved SQL scripts.

This is a small Delphi 11 app that uses the Retail Pro 9's Oracle definition, RPROODS, to connect to Retail Pro's Oracle database and let's you quickly and easily explore the data stored. It was not written to connect to remote database as it was written in an afternoon to help debug a RPro 9 plugin and don't have an immediate need for anything further at this point.

I compiled it (click on "Releases") so you can simply download and run it.
